## 🚀 Quick Start Guide for New Developers

### Prerequisites
```bash
# System Requirements
Node.js >= 18.0.0
npm >= 8.0.0
Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
Redis (for distributed coordination)

# Check your system
node --version && npm --version
```

### 30-Second Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install globally
npm install -g @clduab11/gemini-flow

# 2. Initialize with dual protocol support
gemini-flow init --protocols a2a,mcp --topology hierarchical

# 3. Spawn coordinated agent teams
gemini-flow agents spawn --count 20 --coordination "intelligent"

# 4. Monitor A2A coordination in real-time
gemini-flow monitor --protocols --performance
```

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/clduab11/gemini-flow.git
cd gemini-flow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Initialize development database
npm run db:init

# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run test suite
npm test

# Start monitoring dashboard
npm run monitoring:start
```

### Your First Agent Swarm
```typescript
// examples/my-first-swarm.ts
import { GeminiFlow } from '@clduab11/gemini-flow';

const flow = new GeminiFlow({
  protocols: ['a2a', 'mcp'],
  topology: 'hierarchical',
  maxAgents: 10
});

async function deployMyFirstSwarm() {
  // Initialize swarm
  await flow.swarm.init({
    objective: 'Process customer data',
    agents: ['data-processor', 'validator', 'reporter']
  });
  
  // Monitor results
  flow.on('task-complete', (result) => {
    console.log('Task completed:', result);
  });
  
  // Start processing
  await flow.orchestrate({
    task: 'Analyze customer behavior patterns',
    priority: 'high'
  });
}

deployMyFirstSwarm();
```

### Configuration Wizard
```bash
# Interactive configuration setup
gemini-flow configure --interactive

# This will guide you through:
# ✓ Protocol selection (A2A, MCP, or both)
# ✓ Authentication setup (Google Cloud, OpenAI, Anthropic)
# ✓ Performance tuning (based on your hardware)
# ✓ Monitoring and alerting preferences
# ✓ Development vs Production settings
```

## 🎯 Advanced Configuration

```typescript
// .gemini-flow/config.ts
export default {
  protocols: {
    a2a: {
      enabled: true,
      messageTimeout: 5000,
      retryAttempts: 3,
      encryption: 'AES-256-GCM'
    },
    mcp: {
      enabled: true,
      contextSyncInterval: 100,
      modelCoordination: 'intelligent',
      fallbackStrategy: 'round-robin'
    }
  },
  swarm: {
    maxAgents: 66,
    topology: 'hierarchical',
    consensus: 'byzantine-fault-tolerant',
    coordinationProtocol: 'a2a'
  },
  performance: {
    sqliteOps: 396610,
    routingLatency: 75,
    a2aLatency: 25,
    parallelTasks: 10000
  },
  // Optional quantum enhancement for complex optimization
  quantum: {
    enabled: false, // Enable for advanced optimization tasks
    qubits: 20,
    simulationMode: 'classical-enhanced'
  }
}
```

## ⚛️ Advanced: Quantum-Enhanced Processing (Optional)

For complex optimization scenarios, Gemini-Flow offers optional quantum-enhanced processing capabilities:

### 🎯 When to Enable Quantum Enhancement

```bash
# Enable quantum processing for complex optimization problems
gemini-flow quantum enable --mode "optimization"

# Financial portfolio optimization with quantum advantage
gemini-flow optimize portfolio \
  --assets 50 \
  --quantum-enhanced true \
  --protocols a2a,mcp

# Results: Up to 15% improvement in complex optimization scenarios
```

**Perfect for**: Portfolio optimization, route planning, resource allocation, molecular simulation, cryptographic applications

**Note**: Quantum features are optional and designed for specific use cases requiring advanced optimization capabilities.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Installation Issues

**Issue: Node.js version incompatibility**
```bash
# Error: "gemini-flow requires Node.js >= 18.0.0"
# Solution: Update Node.js
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
npm install -g @clduab11/gemini-flow
```

**Issue: SQLite compilation errors on ARM/M1 Macs**
```bash
# Error: "node-gyp rebuild failed"
# Solution: Install native dependencies
npm install -g node-gyp
xcode-select --install
npm rebuild sqlite3 --build-from-source
```

**Issue: Redis connection failures**
```bash
# Error: "Redis connection refused"
# Solution: Start Redis service
# macOS: brew services start redis
# Linux: sudo systemctl start redis
# Docker: docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

### Performance Issues

**Issue: High memory usage with large agent swarms**
```yaml
# Problem: Memory consumption exceeding 8GB
# Solution: Optimize agent configuration
agents:
  maxConcurrent: 50  # Reduce from default 100
  memoryLimit: "256MB"  # Set per-agent limit
  pooling:
    enabled: true
    maxIdle: 10
```

**Issue: Slow agent spawn times**
```bash
# Problem: Agent spawning >500ms
# Solution: Enable agent pooling
gemini-flow config set agent.pooling.enabled true
gemini-flow config set agent.pooling.warmupCount 10

# Pre-warm agent pool
gemini-flow agents warmup --count 20 --types coder,analyst
```

**Issue: Network latency affecting A2A coordination**
```javascript
// Solution: Optimize network settings
{
  "network": {
    "timeout": 5000,
    "retryAttempts": 3,
    "keepAlive": true,
    "compression": true,
    "batchRequests": true
  }
}
```

### Authentication Problems

**Issue: Google Cloud authentication failures**
```bash
# Error: "Application Default Credentials not found"
# Solution: Setup authentication
gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/service-account.json"

# Verify authentication
gemini-flow auth verify --provider google
```

**Issue: OpenAI API rate limits**
```bash
# Error: "Rate limit exceeded"
# Solution: Configure intelligent rate limiting
gemini-flow config set openai.rateLimit.rpm 3000
gemini-flow config set openai.rateLimit.tpm 250000
gemini-flow config set openai.retryStrategy "exponential-backoff"
```

### Agent Coordination Issues

**Issue: Byzantine consensus timeouts**
```yaml
# Problem: Consensus failing with >1000 agents
# Solution: Adjust consensus parameters
consensus:
  algorithm: "raft"  # Switch from Byzantine for large swarms
  timeout: 10000     # Increase timeout
  minQuorum: 0.51    # Reduce quorum requirement
```

**Issue: Memory leaks in long-running swarms**
```bash
# Solution: Enable automatic cleanup
gemini-flow config set agents.autoCleanup true
gemini-flow config set agents.maxLifetime "24h"
gemini-flow config set memory.gcInterval "300s"
```

## 📋 Migration Guide: v1.1 → v1.2.1

### Breaking Changes
```typescript
// v1.1 (OLD)
const flow = new GeminiFlow({
  mode: 'enterprise'
});

// v1.2.1 (NEW)
const flow = new GeminiFlow({
  protocols: ['a2a', 'mcp'],  // Required
  topology: 'hierarchical'    // Required
});
```

### Configuration Updates
```bash
# Step 1: Backup current configuration
cp .gemini-flow/config.json .gemini-flow/config-v1.1.backup.json

# Step 2: Run migration script
gemini-flow migrate --from 1.1 --to 1.2.1

# Step 3: Verify new configuration
gemini-flow config validate
```

### Agent Definition Changes
```javascript
// v1.1 Agent Definition
{
  "name": "data-processor",
  "type": "worker",
  "capabilities": ["data", "processing"]
}

// v1.2.1 Agent Definition
{
  "name": "data-processor",
  "type": "specialized",      // Changed from 'worker'
  "capabilities": ["data", "processing"],
  "protocols": ["a2a"],       // New: Protocol specification
  "coordination": "intelligent" // New: Coordination mode
}
```

### API Endpoint Updates
```typescript
// v1.1 API Calls
await geminiFlow.spawn({ count: 10 });

// v1.2.1 API Calls
await geminiFlow.agents.spawn({ 
  count: 10,
  coordination: 'intelligent',
  protocols: ['a2a', 'mcp']
});
```

### Database Schema Migration
```bash
# Automatic migration (recommended)
gemini-flow db migrate --auto

# Manual migration (for custom schemas)
gemini-flow db migrate --manual --review-changes

# Rollback if needed
gemini-flow db rollback --to-version 1.1.0
```
