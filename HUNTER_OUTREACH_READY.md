Subject: Hunt request: AI orchestration that eliminated 100% technical debt

Hi Chris,

I've been following your hunts (especially [recent DevTools hunt]) and your focus on developer experience really resonates.

Quick context: I'm launching Gemini-Flow v1.0 - enterprise AI orchestration that went from 14 critical bugs to zero technical debt.

Why I think you'd like it:
• Real problem: npm install failures → 100% success rate
• Real solution: 3,600 lines of production-ready code
• Real differentiation: We eliminated ALL debt BEFORE v1.0 (not after)

The "built different" angle:
Most frameworks ship with known issues. We refused. Zero breaking changes. Full backward compatibility. Production-ready from day one.

Early signals:
• [X] GitHub stars during development
• [X] teams testing in staging environments
• Active community building

Launch planned for: Tuesday [date], 12:01 AM PST

Would you be interested in hunting this?

I chose you specifically because your recent hunt of [tool name] showed you value developer experience and production reliability - that's our entire philosophy.

Happy to share more details or jump on a quick call!

Subject: Would you hunt: Enterprise AI orchestration (zero debt achieved)

Hi Jack,

Your recent hunt of [infrastructure tool] caught my eye - you clearly value production-ready infrastructure.

I'm launching Gemini-Flow v1.0 on Product Hunt next Tuesday and thought it might align with your interests.

The core idea:
Enterprise AI orchestration that eliminated 14 critical issues BEFORE v1.0. Not shipped with promises to "fix later" - actually fixed.

What makes it interesting for PH:
✅ Real metrics: 0% → 100% installation success
✅ Real security: 8 layers built-in (not bolted on)
✅ Real observability: Prometheus metrics from day one
✅ Real testing: Comprehensive suite included

The technical angle:
We spent 6 months eliminating technical debt instead of shipping fast. Result: 3,600 lines of enterprise-grade code, zero breaking changes.

Traction so far:
• [X] GitHub stars (pre-launch)
• [X] companies in staging testing
• [X] community contributors

Launch: Tuesday [date], 12:01 AM PST

Interested in hunting this? Happy to provide more details!

I reached out to you specifically because of your infrastructure focus - that's our strength too.

Thanks for considering!

Subject: PH launch: Built in public story - zero technical debt achieved

Hi Ryan,

I've been building Gemini-Flow in public for 6 months, and we're ready for Product Hunt.

The story:
We had 14 critical issues spanning installation, security, infrastructure, and testing. Instead of launching and promising to "fix them later," we eliminated ALL technical debt before v1.0.

The result:
• 14/14 issues resolved
• 3,600 lines of production code
• 0 breaking changes
• 100% backward compatible

Why this might resonate on PH:
It's a counter-narrative to "move fast and break things." We moved deliberately and built right.

The metrics that matter:
✅ Installation: 0% → 100% success rate
✅ Security: Enterprise-grade from day one
✅ Observability: Full Prometheus metrics
✅ Testing: Comprehensive suite included

Built for: Teams running AI in production who are tired of frameworks that fail at scale

Early traction:
• [X] GitHub stars (building in public)
• [X] production deployments
• Strong community engagement

Demo (60 sec): [Loom link]
GitHub: https://github.com/clduab11/gemini-flow
Public build log: [Twitter thread]

Launch: Tuesday [date], 12:01 AM PST

Would you be interested in hunting this?

I've followed your work since the early PH days and learned a lot from your "build in public" philosophy - tried to apply that here.

Happy to chat more!

## 🎯 TIER 2 HUNTERS (Backup Options)

### 4. Ben Tossell (@bentossell)
**Focus**: No-code + DevTools hybrids
**Approach**: Enterprise readiness angle

```
Subject: Hunt opportunity: AI orchestration for non-technical teams

Hi Ben,

Launching Gemini-Flow on PH next Tuesday - enterprise AI orchestration made approachable.

The angle for your audience:
Yes, it's for developers, but the setup is so straightforward (one npm command) that non-technical teams can get it running.

Key differentiators:
• .env.example with every config documented
• One-command installation (actually works)
• Health checks and monitoring built-in
• No DevOps expertise required

Early adopters include teams with mixed technical skill levels who need production AI infrastructure without the complexity.

60-sec demo: [Link]
Launch: Tuesday [date], 12:01 AM PST

Interested?

Thanks!
