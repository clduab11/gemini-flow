# Legacy Claude Artifacts Migration Notes

## Migration Date
January 2025

## Purpose
This migration removes legacy Claude-specific artifacts and references from the gemini-flow repository to achieve full Gemini CLI parity and clean architecture.

## Archived Components

### 1. .claude/ Directory
- **Location**: `docs/migration/legacy-archive/.claude/`
- **Contents**: Complete Claude configuration system including:
  - Agent definitions and templates
  - Command documentation
  - Helper scripts and automation
  - Settings and configuration files

### 2. CLAUDE.md Configuration
- **Location**: `docs/migration/legacy-CLAUDE.md`  
- **Contents**: Original Claude Code configuration for SPARC development environment
- **Key Features Preserved**: 
  - Concurrent execution patterns
  - Agent coordination protocols
  - Performance optimization strategies

## Migration Actions Performed

### Removed
- [x] Root `.claude/` directory (archived)
- [x] Root `CLAUDE.md` file (moved to migration docs)

### Preserved for Reference
- Claude-flow command parity mappings
- Agent coordination principles
- Performance benchmarking capabilities
- SPARC methodology patterns

## Integration with Gemini-Flow

The archived materials serve as reference for:
1. **Command Structure**: Mapping claude-flow commands to gemini-flow equivalents
2. **Agent Patterns**: Reusable agent coordination patterns  
3. **Performance Strategies**: Optimization techniques adapted for Gemini
4. **Development Workflows**: SPARC and other methodologies

## Notes
- Do not restore archived files directly without careful review
- Update all paths and references when extracting patterns
- Consider security implications of any restored components
- Test compatibility with current gemini-flow architecture

## Next Steps
1. Update package.json metadata to remove Claude references
2. Implement --gemini flag support in CLI commands
3. Replace internal claude-flow references with gemini-flow
4. Update documentation to reflect Gemini-first architecture
