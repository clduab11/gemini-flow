## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Metrics
- Code coverage: >75% (configurable)
- Code complexity: Monitored and reported
- Technical debt: TODO/FIXME tracking
- Documentation coverage: Tracked and scored

### Performance Thresholds
- CPU performance: Baseline comparison
- Memory usage: Leak detection
- I/O performance: Throughput monitoring
- Load testing: Response time and throughput validation

### Security Thresholds
- Critical vulnerabilities: 0 allowed
- High vulnerabilities: <5 allowed
- Secret detection: 0 secrets allowed
- License compliance: Only approved licenses

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Development**: Feature branch deployments
2. **Staging**: Automated deployment from `main` branch
3. **Production**: Manual approval required

### Deployment Process
1. Pre-deployment security and quality checks
2. Container build and security scanning
3. Staging deployment and integration testing
4. Manual approval for production (if applicable)
5. Blue-green production deployment
6. Post-deployment monitoring and verification

### Rollback Strategy
- Immediate rollback capability maintained
- Previous version kept active during deployment
- Automated health checks trigger rollback if needed
- Manual rollback commands documented

## Monitoring and Observability

### Build Monitoring
- Build performance metrics
- Test execution times
- Artifact sizes and trends
- Security scan results

### Deployment Monitoring
- Deployment success rates
- Rollback frequency
- Performance metrics
- Security posture trends

### Quality Monitoring
- Code quality trends
- Test coverage trends
- Performance regression detection
- Technical debt accumulation

## Configuration

### Required Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatic (provided by GitHub)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Code coverage reporting
- `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`: GitLeaks enterprise features (optional)

### Repository Settings
